## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive project management information system that enables software development teams to plan, track, and manage their work efficiently. The system will provide core functionality for task management, team collaboration, and project visibility.

**Scope includes:**
- Task and issue tracking with customizable workflows
- Visual kanban board for task management
- Sprint planning and iteration management
- Team collaboration features
- Real-time progress tracking and reporting
- User and permission management

**Out of scope:**
- Time tracking and billing
- Resource management across multiple projects
- Advanced reporting and analytics (Phase 2)
- Integration with external systems (initial release)

### 1.2 Background and Current Situation

Modern software development teams require efficient tools to manage complex projects with multiple stakeholders. Currently, many teams either use spreadsheets, multiple disconnected tools, or expensive enterprise solutions that are overly complex for their needs.

The market leaders (Jira, Trello, Pivotal Tracker) demonstrate that teams need:
- Simple visual task organization (Trello's kanban approach)
- Structured workflow management (Jira's issue types and statuses)
- Agile planning capabilities (Pivotal Tracker's story points and velocity)

Our system aims to combine these essential features into a streamlined, cost-effective solution suitable for small to medium-sized development teams.

### 1.3 Stakeholders and Target Audience

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- Development teams (2-20 members)
- Project managers and scrum masters
- Product owners
- Team leads and technical managers

**Target Audience:**
- Software development companies
- Startups and scale-ups
- IT departments in mid-sized organizations
- Remote and distributed teams

**Key Stakeholder Needs:**
- Developers: simple task assignment, clear priorities, minimal overhead
- Project Managers: overview of project status, sprint planning, blocking issues
- Product Owners: backlog management, feature prioritization
- Management: high-level progress visibility, delivery predictability

- **Sprint**: A fixed time period (typically 1-4 weeks) during which specific work must be completed
- **Story Point**: A unit of measure for expressing the estimated effort required to implement a user story
- **Velocity**: The amount of work (in story points) a team completes in a sprint
- **Backlog**: A prioritized list of work items to be completed
- **Epic**: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller stories

**System Terms:**

## 3. Business Needs and Context

### 3.1 Problem Description

Software development teams face several challenges in managing their work:

1. **Lack of visibility**: Teams struggle to understand what work is in progress, what's blocked, and what's coming next
2. **Communication overhead**: Without a centralized system, teams waste time in status meetings and email chains
3. **Poor prioritization**: Work items are not clearly prioritized, leading to context switching and inefficiency
4. **No historical data**: Teams cannot analyze their performance or improve their estimation accuracy
5. **Tool fragmentation**: Using multiple disconnected tools leads to duplication and synchronization issues

These problems result in delayed deliveries, team frustration, and inability to predict project timelines accurately.

### 3.2 Business Processes and Workflows

**Core Workflow 1: Issue Lifecycle**
1. Product owner creates issue in backlog with description and acceptance criteria
2. Team estimates effort during backlog refinement
3. Issue is prioritized and added to sprint during sprint planning
4. Developer moves issue to "In Progress" and begins work
5. Upon completion, issue moves to "Code Review"
6. After approval, issue moves to "Testing"
7. QA validates and moves to "Done" or back to development if issues found
8. Sprint concludes with retrospective and planning for next sprint

**Core Workflow 2: Board Management**
1. Project owner creates board with custom columns matching team workflow
2. Team members create cards representing work items
3. Cards are assigned to team members and tagged with relevant labels
4. Team conducts daily standup reviewing board state
5. Cards move across columns as work progresses
6. Completed cards are archived but remain searchable

**Core Workflow 3: Sprint Planning**
1. Team reviews velocity from previous sprints
2. Product owner presents prioritized backlog items
3. Team discusses and estimates work items using story points
4. Team commits to sprint goal and selected work items
5. Sprint begins with clear capacity and scope
6. Mid-sprint adjustments are made if necessary
7. Sprint ends with demo and retrospective

### 3.3 User and Client Needs

## 7. System Architecture

### 7.1 Architecture Principles and Design Decisions

**Architectural Principles:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility

2. **Scalability First**
   - Stateless application servers for horizontal scaling
   - Database connection pooling and query optimization
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

3. **Security by Design**
   - Authentication at API gateway level
   - Role-based authorization in business layer
   - Input validation at all entry points

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clean code principles
   - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Automated code quality checks

5. **API-First Design**
   - RESTful API as primary interface
   - Frontend as API consumer
   - Enables future mobile apps and integrations

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Backend: Java with Spring Boot**
  - Rationale: Robust ecosystem, enterprise-grade, excellent ORM support
  - Spring Security for authentication/authorization
